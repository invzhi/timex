ðŸ“… A Go package for working with date and time of day.

## Why use timex?

- Self-contained type `Date`, focusing on date-specific operations.
  - Don't rely on type `time.Time`, avoid timezone-related issues.
  - Represent date format like `YYYY-MM-DD` instead of `2006-01-02`.
  - Working with date type of MySQL or PostgreSQL directly.
  - Fast method implementations of `Date` relative to `time.Time`.
- Self-contained type `TimeOfDay`, without date.
  - Simple format like `HH:mm:ss` for clarity.
  - Working with date type of MySQL or PostgreSQL directly.
  - Efficient manipulation of hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds.

## Features

- Fully-implemented type `Date`:
    - Zero value: January 1, year 1. Align with type `time.Time`.
    - Working with standard library: conversion with type `time.Time`.
    - Parsing & Formatting: conversion with formatted strings.
    - Getter: get year, quarter, month, day of year, day of month, day of week.
    - Manipulation: addition and subtraction with years, months, days.
    - Comparison: comparing dates with `Before`, `After`, `Equal`.
    - Database serialization and deserialization.
    - JSON serialization and deserialization.
