ðŸ“… A Go package for working with date.

## Why use timex?

- Self-contained type `Date`, focusing on date-specific operations.
- Don't rely on type `time.Time`, avoid timezone-related issues.
- Represent date format like `YYYY-MM-DD` instead of `2006-01-02`.
- Working with date type of MySQL or PostgreSQL directly.
- Fast method implementations of `Date` relative to `time.Time`.
